# GitHub-map

## Description

The GitHub-map project have for objective to create the GitHub community map. Inspired form the [internet-map](http://www.internet-map.net/), we are using the [GitHub kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/github/github-repos) to create a simple database. Based on this database, we will try to implement de the PageLinkRank Algorithme to place the nodes on the map.

## Database

**repos**

| Column | type | comment |
|-|:-:|:-|
| _repo_name_ | text | Primary key |
| commits | text | Number of commits |
| branches | text | Number of branches |
| releases | text | Number of releases |
| contributors | text | Number of contributors |
| issues | text | Number of opened issues |
| pull_requests | text | Number of openend pull requests |
| watchs | text | Number of viewers |
| starts | text | Number of stars |
| forks | text | Number of forks |
| age | text | Age of the repo |

**users**

| Column | type | comment |
|-|:-:|:-|
| _user_name_ | text | Primary key |
| name | text | Name |
| age | text | Age |

**repos_to_users**

| Column | type | comment |
|-|:-:|:-|
| _user_name_ | text | Foreign key of the repos table |
| _email_ | text | Foreign key of the users table |
| commits | int | Number of commit from the user on the repo |
| issues | int | Number of issues from the user on the repo |

## Prerequisite

Create a [Google API key](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) to query the kaggle database.

**Windows**:
- Install pip  ```python get-pip.py```
- Install [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

**Linux**:
- Install pip ```sudo apt-get install python-pip```
- Copy geckodriver to a sourced path ```sudo cp geckodriver /usr/local/bin/geckodriver```

## Installation

Install the dependencies :
```
sudo pip install google-api-python-client requests bs4 selenium sqlite3 mrjob
```
## Contributing

- test folder : Only here as a sandbox. It is sometime usefull to try queries on the kaggle database before implementing.
- sample folder : Implementation of the final code with only 100 commits instead of 128 millions
- src folder : Implementation of the final code with every commits
